# Webpack boilerplate

## Local Setup
1. Pull this branch into your system.
2. Make sure you have Node installed (preferrably Node v18.17.1).
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`.
4. Once all the dependencies have been installed, spin up the local server with `npm run start` command. This command will also enable live reloading feature.
5. For production build, use `npm run build` command. It will create a **dist** folder.
